# Pnoi-phone

> The Pnoi-phone is an acoustic-based biomedical device for pulmonary function evaluation using the sounds of breath from the mouth and chest recorded simultaneously.

## Overview

Pnoi-phone is an innovative solution aimed at addressing the challenges associated with the diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory diseases, particularly asthma. This project introduces a new `acoustic-based method` for evaluating pulmonary function test values (PFT) using a device called Pnoi-phone. By capturing and analyzing breath sounds, Pnoi-phone can identify abnormal patterns indicative of respiratory diseases, allowing healthcare professionals to diagnose and monitor patients accurately and effortlessly.

## Key Features

> We aim to scale up and introduce Pnoi-phone into the healthcare industry, the following are the main features taken into account:

- **Accurate and Efficient Diagnosis**: Pnoi-phone utilizes advanced acoustic technology to capture and analyze breath sounds, enabling accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases, especially asthma. It assists healthcare professionals in identifying abnormal patterns associated with these conditions.

- **Remote Clinic Accessibility**: With Pnoi-phone, healthcare professionals in remote clinics can access a reliable diagnostic tool for respiratory diseases. This solution aims to bridge the gap in healthcare services and ensure timely intervention and treatment, even in areas with limited resources.

- **Affordability and Portability**: Pnoi-phone has been designed with cost-effectiveness and portability in mind. It is a low-cost device that can be easily transported and used in various healthcare settings, including rural areas with limited infrastructure.

-  **Simplified Usage and Interpretation**: The Pnoi-phone system is user-friendly and requires minimal training for healthcare workers. Its intuitive interface and straightforward interpretation of results facilitate efficient operation and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis.

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Compliance with relevant regulatory guidelines and obtaining necessary certifications is crucial for the successful adoption and acceptance of Pnoi-phone in the healthcare industry. Engaging with regulatory bodies and seeking approvals will be a priority.

## Implementation Plan and Potential Impact

The Pnoi-phone holds great potential to support healthcare in India, where respiratory diseases are prevalent, and many individuals have limited access to diagnostic facilities. 

The implementation plan proposes a phased rollout of the device in select healthcare facilities across the country, considering the specific needs and challenges of the Indian healthcare system. Addressing regulatory approvals, supply chain disruptions, and logistical issues will be crucial to successfully implement and adopt the device within the proposed timeline.

### Future scope

The vision for Pnoi-phone extends beyond diagnosis, as it aims to evolve into a wearable device that can monitor and manage lung diseases. For example, it could autonomously administer asthma medication, enabling patients to lead a normal life without discomfort from the disease. Furthermore, Pnoi-phone has the potential for population-level monitoring of respiratory health, which could have significant implications for public health and disease prevention.

### Partnerships and Widespread Adoption

Successful partnerships with relevant stakeholders, including healthcare providers, researchers, and regulatory bodies, will be crucial to drive widespread adoption of Pnoi-phone and establish new standards for respiratory healthcare. The success of this project could significantly improve respiratory health outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals not only in India but also around the world.
